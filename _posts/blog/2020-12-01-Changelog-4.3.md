Side note:

I am starting to maintain a distribution of rTorrent, available at [jesec/rtorrent](https://github.com/jesec/rtorrent). It is optimized and small. It uses modern CMake and Bazel build systems. Bazel can also be used for dependency management and to produce statically linked reproducible builds.

Static binaries (amd64, arm64) can be downloaded via [Github Actions](https://github.com/jesec/rtorrent/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+rolling+build%22). Docker images are also available at [jesec/rtorrent](https://hub.docker.com/r/jesec/rtorrent).

I made a simple [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jesec/flood/blob/5cc56067c3be6c91ccf94f71d4784be99c2823f8/Dockerfile.rtorrent) to demonstrate how to integrate rTorrent with Flood.
